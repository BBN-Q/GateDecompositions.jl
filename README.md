# GateDecompositions

[![Build Status](https://github.com/BBN-Q/GateDecompositions.jl/workflows/CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/BBN-Q/GateDecompositions.jl/actions)

A small Julia package that contains code to perform Cartan's KAK decomposition on unitary matrices.

Written in a superconducting quantum computing context, so will decompose a U(4) unitary into the minimal 3-CNOT (3 ZX90) circuit.
